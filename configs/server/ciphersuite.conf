# ciphersuite.conf for the SttreamServer
#
# This is the configuration for ciphersuites to be used by
# the StreamServer when sending a movie to proxies.

# These are session-ciphersuite configuration examples.
# Can have different combinations of correct and supported
# block or stream encryption algorithms, as well as proper
# modes and secure padding methods.
# Then your implementation must be beneric for different security
# cryptographic configurations

# Notes on the above configuration example:
# a) mac and hash ciphersuites can be used alternatively
#    but must be supported both in the configuration and implementation
# b) for the case of mac ciphersuites, your solution must be ready to use
#    use HMACs, as well as CMACs, transparently.
# b) all the required keys are stored in the configured keystore 
#    (storetype jecks)
# c) if you want you can also use PKCS12 ksystores. 
#    See keytool and java docs for details
# d) of course that you will need in certain configurations (modes) 
#    initialization vectors or counters.
#    However your solutio must manage the establishment of such vectors
#    and counters in a dynamic secure way (no need to be statically defined)
